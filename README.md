# simple-encrypt-decrypt_v1
Created by Kyle Noel, 20Jun2022

A simple encryption/decryption tool written in C++ for Windows.

This program can act as a framework for encryption algorithms. 
Simply replace the simple algorithm in place with any algorithm that 
accepts an encryption key and returns a char. See code comments.

This version contains a simple addition/subtraction encryption/decryption system 
designed to simply showcase the functionality of this program. 
I anticipate developing a v2 with a more complex algorithm in the near future.

**Do not encrypt/decrypt files you do not have permission to encrypt/decrypt.
